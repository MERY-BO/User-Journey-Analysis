Customer Journey Analysis
Overview
This analysis focuses on understanding customer behavior on a website by examining user journeys through various pages, identifying key patterns, and evaluating differences between subscription plans. The analysis provides insights into which pages and sequences are most engaging, user behavior leading up to purchases, and how different subscription types influence navigation paths.

Metrics Implemented
To obtain valuable insights, we created a series of metrics:

Page Count: Counts how often each page appears across all user journeys, allowing us to identify the most frequently visited pages.

Page Presence: Similar to Page Count, but counts each page only once per journey, providing insight into how many journeys each page is part of.

Page Destination: Identifies the most common pages that follow each page in a userâ€™s journey, giving insight into user navigation patterns and popular follow-up actions.

Page Sequences: Examines common sequences of N pages in user journeys (e.g., the most popular sequence of three pages) and counts each sequence only once per journey. This shows typical patterns or paths users follow.

Journey Length: Calculates the average length of user journeys (in terms of pages visited), allowing comparison across different user segments and subscription plans.

Subscription Plan Segmentation
In addition to calculating these metrics for the entire dataset, the analysis allows segmentation by subscription type (e.g., monthly, quarterly, annual). By examining these metrics separately for each plan, we gain insights into how different subscriber types interact with the site, highlighting unique behaviors based on subscription frequency.

Key Insights
This analysis enables us to answer questions such as:

Which pages and sequences are most popular?
What pages tend to follow specific pages like the Pricing page?
How do behaviors vary across different subscription plans?
What is the typical length of a user journey?
